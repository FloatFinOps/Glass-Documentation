# .Net framework updation from 6 to 8

## 1. Project framework update

In the solution, for each project, need to update the framework to .net 8. Find the .csproj file of each project, then update below item:

From <TargetFramework>net6.0</TargetFramework>
To   <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>

After updating the framework, the API project no longer using startup.cs, all the code within it has been integrated with program.cs. Check latest code for this update, history check point is pull request:

## 2. Nuget package update

For each project, the nuget packages may no longer compatible with the new framework, so it's important to upgrade corresponding packages. Different project are referencing different packages, focus on Microsoft's packages first, which are closely related with the framework.

As the upgradation is from .Net 6 to .Net 8, the purpose will be updating the packages from 6.x to 8.x version, which typically compatible with the version number of 8. Just a few packages are having their own version numbers which do not follow the .Net version number. 

Below are the packages which were upgraded within this upgradation:
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration" Version="8.0.0" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.AzureAppConfiguration" Version="8.1.1" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection" Version="8.0.1" />

## 3. Azure Function Update

### 3.1 Azure Function mode

Other than the nuget package updation, Azure function needs to run in isolated mode with .Net 8. The updation is following this documentation: 
`https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/dotnet-isolated-process-guide?tabs=hostbuilder%2Cwindows`

In terraform where Azure function was defined, proccessor.tf, find the function block update below values:

1) Update FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME
    From:   "dotnet"
    To:     "dotnet-isolated"

2) Update variable "dotnet_version":
    From:   "6.0"
    To:     "8"

3) Added "FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION":
    With value: "~4"

4) Added site_config.application_stack.use_dotnet_isolated_runtime:
    With value: true
    

For Azure Function project, need to add below item in its .csproj file:
    <ItemGroup>
        <Using Include="System.Threading.ExecutionContext" Alias="ExecutionContext"/>
    </ItemGroup>

### 3.2 Local development

Another change is for running Azure function locally, it used to run with Azure Storage Emulator which is a local service to support Azure function locally. After upgraded to .Net 8, it's replaced by a new service called Azurite Emulator. Please follow this documentation to set it up: 
`https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite?tabs=visual-studio%2Cblob-storage`

### 3.3 Azure Function code update

Along with the package updation, the function code needs to update too. Main changes are:

1) No longer using an output servicer bus to output the message, need to send message by calling service bus helper instead, so need to inject the helper and define the output queue in function constructor.

2) "FunctionName" annotation is no longer in use, just "Function".


## 4. Github Deployment Update

As the project has been updated to .Net 8, so the workflow main.yml file needs to be compatible too.

Main changes are:

1) Update DOTNET_VERSION:
    From:   '6.0.x'
    To:     '8.0.x' 

2) Update command in one step which installing EF tool:
    From:   dotnet tool install dotnet-ef --version 6.*
    TO:     dotnet tool install dotnet-ef --version 8.*


## 5. Docker Configuration Update

Update the Dockerfile environment in 2 API projects:
    From:   FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0 AS base
    To:     FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
